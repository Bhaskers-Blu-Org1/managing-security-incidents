# Summary

By integrating the Resilient Incident Response Platform (IRP) with IBM QRadar, security teams are empowered to simplify and streamline the process of escalating and managing incidents. When offenses are escalated from IBM QRadar into Resilient's IRP, the platform generates a detailed, incident-specific response plan that enables team members to quickly respond.

# Technologies

* [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)): Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based and object-oriented.

* [Security Information and Event Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management): In the field of computer security, security information and event management (SIEM) software products and services combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). They provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. 

* [Incident Response Platform](https://www.resilientsystems.com/our-platform/):The Resilient Incident Response Platform (IRP) with Intelligent Orchestration seamlessly combines case management, orchestration, automation, and intelligence into a single platform – enabling security teams can deliver a fast, agile, and laser-focused response to complex cyberattacks.

# Description

Security incidents rarely emerge fully formed with flashing lights to alert you of their presence. More often, they start to appear as a set of indicators or separate smaller events. It isn’t uncommon for mid- to large-sized organizations to experience thousands, if not millions, of security events in a single day. So what’s your plan to find the signal amid the noise?

A good first step is to use a security information and event management (SIEM) solution. A security plan that includes SIEM helps to reduce the number of variables in play and focus response efforts. For example, the IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform, powered by the Sense Analytics Engine, collects a massive amount of data, such as list logs, network flows, vulnerability data, external threat intelligence feeds and more, to formulate security intelligence that helps teams focus their efforts on a prioritized list of offenses — the events and incidents that require immediate action.

Now that you have a prioritized list of offenses, what’s your plan for taking action? What are the next steps? Who is on the response team and how will they communicate? Are you required to issue privacy breach notifications?

A purpose-built incident response platform (IRP) can help your security team orchestrate a precise and rapid response. Serving as a single, central hub for managing responses, the IRP enables clear communication across the organization and delivers focused insight on the next steps required to contain and resolve the incident.

This code pattern will demonstrate an integration between IBM Resilient IRP and IBM QRadar SIEM, where the offences in the QRadar are automatically escalated to the their respective organization in the IBM Resilient.


# Flow

![](images/Architecture.png)

1. Get all the offences from the IBM QRadar.
2. Convert these offences into Resilient incident format.
3. Send these incidents to their respective organization.

# Instructions

# Announcement

Today’s security information and event management systems (SIEM) operate with a more extensive knowledge base than their predecessors, and they are more useful in detecting and logging data than ever before—but they are never more powerful than when they are paired with a incident response (IR) platform.

The technical capabilities and reach of cybercriminals are now equal to those of many governments and organizations. In the next few years, these capabilities will extend far beyond those of their victims. As a result, the ability of current control mechanisms to protect organizations is likely to diminish, exposing them to greater impact.

With increasingly agile cybercriminals at the helm of some of the most sophisticated attacks, SIEM paired with a incident response platform provides a complete, comprehensive defense system against even the most advanced, persistent threats. This powerful combination allows IR teams to take an expansive view of incident and threat management with the confidence that they are backed by a powerful unified incident response mechanism to respond, contain, and mitigate threats in real-time, as they develop.

This code pattern will demonstrate an integration between IBM Resilient IRP and IBM QRadar SIEM, where the offences in the QRadar are automatically escalated to the their respective organization in the IBM Resilient.
